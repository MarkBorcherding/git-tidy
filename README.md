> "Clean up your repo or you're not getting any desert!"

## What it does

`git tidy` deletes all branches that are merged into your current branch from your local repo and also deletes all remote branches that have been merged in.

## What about `master`? 

Well, maybe not all the branches.

## Installation

Put `git-tidy` on your path somehow.

## Usage

Just run `git tidy` while on a branch.
